Description
------------------------
This program takes a Lost Kingdoms (USA) .iso file and produces a new .iso with the card pickups randomized.

How to Use This Program
------------------------
* Keep LKrandomizer.exe and data folder in same directory
* Run LKrandomizer.exe
* Press 'Select .iso' button and choose a clean Lost Kingdoms disc image
* Choose the options you want to include
* Input a custom seed or leave it random
* Seeds must be between one to ten characters and only consist of letters
* Press 'Start Randomization' button
* The button will turn to yellow, indicating your .iso is being copied and patched
* A message box will pop up once complete
* A new .iso and/or log.txt will show up in this directory

------------------------
F.A.Q.
------------------------
* Will the same seed but different options have the same cards?
- All random options must be the same for the same result, but the difficulty options will not impact randomization.
* Are the side level chests randomized?
- Not yet
* Are the fairy chests or key item chests randomized?
- Not yet
* Is it possible to start with an unviable deck?
- Rare, but yes
* Why are some enemy attributes not randomized?
- There's a 1-in-5 chance of the enemy keeping it's original attribute
